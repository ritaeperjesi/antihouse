Hi!

This is my submission! ( please only look at it after 12. March midnight!)

## PRESENTATION
My presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W79SsjN6jePCzkNWx242nxxzwqsshYgyr_rb-h1Ru-A/edit?usp=sharing

## DOCUMENTATION
It's the readme file in the antihouse folder: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/README.md
This is my repository of the project with more documents: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse

## FILES
This is where my Unity project is: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/git_antihouse

## HOW TO VIEW MY PROJECT
### COMFORTABLE SCENARIO: Internet
I recorded a gameplay. You can watch it here. 

### LESS IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop
Unity build? 

### IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop + Oculus Quest. 
Actually this is still not superideal for you, as my project is not published to the Oculus Quest, so uploading something to it requires extra things to download.

#### Version A: Unity + Android SDK + Quest
This is how I do things, so I assume, if you do it the same way, it can work. 
I'm using: 
- Unity 2019.2.10f1. https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
- Oculus Quest 
1. I followed this tutorial to setup my Unity+Quest developer environment. https://circuitstream.com/blog/oculus-quest-unity-setup/
 If you follow it until "Create a new Unity project", we have the same environment, and if you open my Unity project hopefully the rest is going to be there.
 Turn on developer mode on your phone in Oculus app, that is also important.
  When you have my project open, and your Oculus Quest plugged into the computer, just check the "Launch your project onto your Oculus Quest" part in the very same tutorial.

  Don't let outdated android things stop you.

 Hopefully now you can watch the experience in your Oculus. 
 
 Some little things: You can't teleport or do anything with the controllers in the experience so far, you are just a viewer. And I developed it in my room, so I was mostly in one position standing, feel free to walk around, but I don't know how things will be experienced that way.

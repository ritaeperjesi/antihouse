Hi!

This is my submission! ( please only look at it after 12. March midnight!)

## PRESENTATION
My presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W79SsjN6jePCzkNWx242nxxzwqsshYgyr_rb-h1Ru-A/edit?usp=sharing

## DOCUMENTATION
It's the readme file in the antihouse folder: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/README.md
This is my repository of the project with more documents: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse

## FILES
This is where my Unity project is: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/git_antihouse

## HOW TO VIEW MY PROJECT
### COMFORTABLE SCENARIO: Internet
I recorded a gameplay. You can watch it here.

### LESS IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop
In the Builds/windows folder you can find the antihous_win.exe, which you can play. You can walk as in all the usual computer games and you can look around with moving the mouse. You are missing out from the spatial experience, which is the point of the whole project, but you can see what I tried to do at least. 

### IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop + Oculus Quest. 
Actually this is still not superideal for you, as my project is not published to the Oculus Quest, so uploading something to it requires extra things to download.

#### Version A: Sideloading on your Quest
I've created a build, which in theory should be working. It's in the git_antihouse/antihouse folder, and it's very creatively called antihouse_oculusbuild.apk.
I found this tutorial on how to add apk files to your Quest from external source:
https://uploadvr.com/sideloading-quest-how-to/#:~:text=All%20you%20need%20to%20do,of%20the%20official%20SideQuest%20apps

#### Version B: Unity + Android SDK + Quest
This is how I do things, so I assume, if you do it the same way, it can work. 
I'm using: 
- Unity 2019.2.10f1. https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
- Oculus Quest 
1. I followed this tutorial to setup my Unity+Quest developer environment. https://circuitstream.com/blog/oculus-quest-unity-setup/
 If you follow it until "Create a new Unity project", we have the same environment, and if you open my Unity project hopefully the rest is going to be there.
 Turn on developer mode on your phone in Oculus app, that is also important.
  When you have my project open, and your Oculus Quest plugged into the computer, just check the "Launch your project onto your Oculus Quest" part in the very same tutorial.

  Don't let outdated android things stop you.

 Hopefully now you can watch the experience in your Oculus. 
 If something is not good, I'd check the tutorial's Build settings if it is the same. 
 
 Some little things: You can't teleport or do anything with the controllers in the experience so far, you are just a viewer. And I developed it in my room, so I was mostly in one position standing, feel free to walk around, but I don't know how things will be experienced that way.

Hi!

This is my submission!

## PRESENTATION
My presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W79SsjN6jePCzkNWx242nxxzwqsshYgyr_rb-h1Ru-A/edit?usp=sharing

## DOCUMENTATION
It's the readme file in the antihouse folder: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/README.md

## FILES
This is where my Unity project is: https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/git_antihouse

## HOW TO VIEW MY PROJECT
### IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop + Oculus Quest. 
Actually this is still not superideal for you, as my project is not published to the Oculus Quest, so uploading something to it requires extra things to download.

### LESS IDEAL SCENARIO: Windows laptop
Unity build? 

### COMFORTABLE SCENARIO: Internet
I recorded a gameplay. You can watch it here.

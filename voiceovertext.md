khm. khm.
hello. hi! I'm here. Not THERE. I mean, yes, there as well. But also all around. 
I'm the Space. The space around you. You know, the air. Not the air actually. The shape of the air. But not the walls. The emptiness between the walls. But it is not empty. There is the air. And you. And the robot vacuum cleaner. 
I hope now you get it. The space.

I guess you didn't even notice me at first. Don't worry, it is fine, I'm quite used to this. Sometimes some architects get very enthusiastic about me, but that's it. Everybody else just looks through me.

So, you are hanging out in virtual reality, huh? Isn't it interesting? They have put me here as well. They said: ok space, you are free now. do whatever you want here! pff. I don't know what they mean by free.

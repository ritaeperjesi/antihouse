khm. khm.
hello. hi! I'm here. Not THERE. I mean, yes, there as well. But also all around. 
I'm the Space. The space around you. You know, the air. Not the air actually. The shape of the air. Not the walls. The emptiness between the walls. Which is not really empty. There is the air. And you. And the robot vacuum cleaner. 
I hope you kinda get it. The space.

I guess you didn't even notice me at first. Don't worry, it is fine, I'm used to this. Sometimes some fancy architects get very enthusiastic about me, but that's it. Everybody else looks through me.

So, you are hanging out in virtual reality, huh? Isn't it interesting? Somehow I got here as well, I don't know. They said: ok space, you are free now. do whatever you want here! pff. I don't really know what they mean by free. I mean, what could I do here? 

Should I be maybe a bit taller? Well, in the analogue world I didn't really have the chance. They were always coming up with stupid excuses... "Oh, you can't build such a high building made of wood. Oh, this structure is too expensive!" Well hello Burj Khalifa!You think you're the highest building on Earth with your eighthundred-twenty-eight meters? I'm 829 now! And I just need gummybears, look! stable structure, ha! 

All right, this was nice.
But being high is not the only way to grow. I can become bigger. A lot bigger! Look mum, no beams! 
Look, I'm so big, you don't even see me anymore! Wooh! I'm still growing! Meter by meter! What do you think? How far can I go? Infinity? Isn't it amazing? Although it is getting a bit pointless. You don't even see me anymore. 

Hey, but I can also take a look at you from really close! Or you can take a look at me. Upsz, sorry, maybe this was too much. Maybe this way?

outro:
Do you know what is weird? That you have been always the one leaving me. I was here. Standing. Waiting. All The Time. You come whenever you want, you go whenever you want. And you pretend like nothing happened. You don't even ask if it is ok for me. What about my schedule? My feelings? What if I'm with somebody else already? You know what, I had enough. Finally I can just leave. Thank you virtual reality. Bye.

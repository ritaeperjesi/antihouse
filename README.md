## Concept
This is an experience exploring the possibilities of creating spaces in virtual reality. Architecture is based on rules of reality: gravity, the strenght of materials, the size of humans and our ability of how we can move in spaces, all these aspects give limitations and shape our spaces. In virtual reality these rules can be modified easily. 100 meter high towers can be built from gummybears, we are able to teleport, materials and spaces are not contrapoints. What can we do with all these possibilities?

## Storyline
You are standing in a room, and a voice starts talking to you. It's the space around you, who got into the virtual reality, and is a bit confused what to do with this situation.
She is trying to find her function and shape in this digital world, by going through tha usual architypes of spaces, their aspects, elements, and opening new horizonts. 
The space is changing according to it's ideas. 
The function of the human can be also reconsidered in this story. 
The end can be an interactive open ending, where the human can change it to his/her liking. 

#### Introduction
Hi, I'm the space around you. I guess you didn't even see me, usually people just look through me, it's fine, I'm kind of used to this. 


#### Scale
Should I be small? Should I be big? I can actually be infinitely big! Hello, Burj Khalifa with your 828 meters, look at me! I can do the same but also made of gummybears, isn't it cool? or i can just balance on a needle too, can you do that? 

small-big-infinite
#### Shape
cube-sphere-weird generative morph
#### Architypes

#### Elements
Greek coloumns turning into wobbly dancing gummi thingies
walls opening with more and more windows, turn into bubble 
handforest (ij ust write it here not to forget)

## Diary

#### 09.11. consultation with Stefan
Homework: 
- set up environment
- oculus quest + unity
- unity + github

#### 12.11. consultation with Miklós
- "normal" people are not really into spaces. At architecture school you are taught to pay attention to spaces, but otherwise it is quite an abstract way of sensing the world.
- talking space idea
- spaceship house, old architypes of spaces, bubble archtype, where else can this go?
##### Space architypes: 
Research on this more! 
Island, sírbolt, nest, forest, egg
traveling: ship? cave (üreg), tunnel (alagút), church, house, égi jeruzsálem?  - i'm not sure if this is relevant

#### 16.11. consultation with Domi + thinking
-make it black and white - it's only about the space - colors can appear at some point, but it's about their meaning
- Wolves in the Walls VR experience, I love the handmade textures, chalk lines, there is an episode where you go through the wall and you are in between the elements, it is really cool.
Technical:
-Setting up work environment: https://circuitstream.com/blog/oculus-quest-unity-setup/
  I've been following this. 
 Plan: set of spaces and images. 

#### 23.11. consultation with Stefan
Homework:
- houdini to unity
https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-engine/plug-ins/unity-plug-in/
- lighting with oculus might be tricky
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-lighting-and-rendering#

- sound! it could be cool to have the sound reacting to the space (how big it is)
- ask Juli to help with recording it
. worst case, best case storyboard for next week

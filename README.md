# antihouse

## Concept
This is an experience exploring the possibilities of creating spaces in virtual reality. Architecture is based on rules of reality: gravity, the strenght of materials, the size of humans and our ability of how we can move in spaces, all these aspects give limitations and shape our spaces. In virtual reality these rules can be modified easily. 100 meter high towers can be built from gummybears, we are able to teleport, materials and spaces are not contrapoints. What can we do with all these possibilities?

## Storyline
[miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ld9aCN4=/)
You are standing in a room, and a voice starts talking to you. It's the space around you, who got into the virtual reality, and is a bit confused what to do with this situation.
She is trying to find her function and shape in this digital world, by going through tha usual architypes of spaces, their aspects, elements, and opening new horizonts. 
The space is changing according to it's ideas. 
The function of the human can be also reconsidered in this story. 
The end can be an interactive open ending, where the human can change it to his/her liking. 

#### Introduction
Hi, I'm the space around you. I guess you didn't even see me, usually people just look through me, it's fine, I'm kind of used to this. 


#### Scale
Should I be small? Should I be big? I can actually be infinitely big! Hello, Burj Khalifa with your 828 meters, look at me! I can do the same but also made of gummybears, isn't it cool? or i can just balance on a needle too, can you do that? 

small-big-infinite
#### Shape
cube-sphere-weird generative morph

#### In-Out

#### Architypes

#### Elements
Greek coloumns turning into wobbly dancing gummi thingies
walls opening with more and more windows, turn into bubble 
handforest (ij ust write it here not to forget)

## Diary

#### 09.11. consultation with Stefan
Homework: 
- set up environment
- oculus quest + unity
- unity + github

#### 12.11. consultation with Miklós
- "normal" people are not really into spaces. At architecture school you are taught to pay attention to spaces, but otherwise it is quite an abstract way of sensing the world.
- talking space idea
- spaceship house, old architypes of spaces, bubble archtype, where else can this go?

##### Space architypes: 
Research on this more! 
Island, sírbolt, nest, forest, egg
traveling: ship? cave (üreg), tunnel (alagút), church, house, égi jeruzsálem?  - i'm not sure if this is relevant

#### 16.11. consultation with Domi + thinking
-make it black and white - it's only about the space - colors can appear at some point, but it's about their meaning
- Wolves in the Walls VR experience, I love the handmade textures, chalk lines, there is an episode where you go through the wall and you are in between the elements, it is really cool.
Technical:
-Setting up work environment: https://circuitstream.com/blog/oculus-quest-unity-setup/
  I've been following this. 
 Plan: set of spaces and images. 

#### 23.11. consultation with Stefan
Homework:
- houdini to unity
https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-engine/plug-ins/unity-plug-in/
- lighting with oculus might be tricky
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/introduction-to-lighting-and-rendering#
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnG2gOKV9dw
- sound! it could be cool to have the sound reacting to the space (how big it is)
- ask Juli to help with recording it
. worst case, best case storyboard for next week

#### 23.11. consultation with Miklós
[miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ld9aCN4=/)
- the beginning of the storyline is great. I have to figure out the end and what I want to message.


#### 02.12. consultation with ctech

explain well who the space is.

#### 03.12. 
I downloaded a free gummybear model, which I'm not entirely happy with. 
The Houdini engine doesn't work with my free houdini, so i'll have to check if the uni computer has the right houdini licence

#### 06.12. 
Problem: 
I installed the right android platforms i think. 
I'm following this: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Unity/2019.2.10f1/Editor/Data/Documentation/en/Manual/VRDevices-Oculus.html and I need a file, but: 
https://developer.oculus.com/manage/tools/osig-generator/ 
here I can't get my devices number, because adb devices is not a command on my computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwmWGE3fFY
Solution: turn on developer mode on your phone in Oculus app

Questions: houdini licence?

#### 8.12. 
Unity workshop, a very fast sketch for the gummybear tower. Pierre suggested to randomize the directions of them.

#### 10.12. 
consultation with Miklós.
we discussed the meaning of the different visual styles and how far simplifying space can go. Our good friend, Lilla Turi is an illustrator, she is going very well in the world of abstraction. I have to experiment and I'll see what works and what doesn't in this weird 3d world.

#### 17.12. 
I started building a new scene with different textures. I have columns now, and I want to use a robot vacuum cleaner as the reference for the scale. 
First I wanted to use a bird, so it could fly around the space which would indicate well the size of it, but a bird would have to be perfect in terms of moving and how it looks.
A robot vacuum cleaner can be as stupid as it wants to be, I can code its movement, it's also working with scale and boundaries and it's a great companion in this story, as there is not much dirt in vr.

Consultation with Miklós:
We discussed the possibilities with columns, that their scale can be any big, although there are some more usual ones, like the 2floor high ones. 
I want to indicate scale with multiplying the number of columns and not making them bigger in themselves. 
We talked about wallpapers, as they are funny and it is understandable to have them weirdly cut, but I can also cut weirdly columns, but that's less understandable.
What defines scale in 2020 architecture? toilet, lavatory, bathtube, window (1.5x1.5m?), door. 
I kind of like the idea of the magical growing space of a toilet as well, and tiles are giving a scale to everything, but as tiles are usually 15cm, that is too small already and it might lose its importance in bigger scales. 

#### 20.12.
I started watching Daniel Shiffman's [tutorials] (https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/git-and-github/) about Git and Github. It's time to finally learn this thing.
#### 21.12.
Why is Houdini Engine good? [tutorial](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-engine-for-unity-session-sync/) 
This looks really cool.
This doesn't look like a simple thing, but maybe it is not that bad[Building a Simple Houdini Engine Exportertutorial](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/building-a-simple-houdini-engine-exporter/)
This is a nice overview for Houdini with Unity  [3 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlCD7lJubes)

#### 23.12.
Consultation with Stefan about the Houdini-Unity workflow. I'll just try things in Unity first.

#### 01.01.
I started writing my voiceover in English. I watched one more Daniel Shiffman tutorial, I downloaded Githubdesktop and I installed it. Now I kind of can push my files from my desktop to github. 

#### 06.01.
best case- worst case scenario list

#### 10.01.
most details on the worst case scenario
writing the short version of my voiceover.
recording in a bad quality the voiceover. i have to buy AAA batteries to my diktafon. 
And I'm not fully sure if i should be the voice. 

#### 11.01.
editing the voiceover. asking my sound friends about how to record in good quality and if my voice is suitable for being the voice of the space. finalizing my bestcase-worstcase list. discussing it with Stefan. showing my voiceover to a friend, she said i'm using too many "filling" expressions when i talk, which is true. i have to pay more attention to this. 

#### 12.01.
timeplan, best case - worst case list

#### 13.01.
rewriting the concept

#### 21.01.
working in unity: 
- i made the ceiling go up with a script


#### 21.01.
I recorded the short version voiceover with Juli's microphone in good sound quality, less good acting quality than before. 

#### 24.01.
I played a bit with skybox textures, to find a friendlier atmoshphere. 
![basic room](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/unicorn.jpg)

#### 25.01.
I tried to see my world in VR, but something was weird, my gummybear tower was glitching, it was only good if I looked at a specific direction, it felt like maybe the gummybear tower is too much for it. :S
Quick check-in with Stefan.

#### 29.01.
I discussed my voiceover with an editor, he made some little corrections.

#### 15.02
Talking with Stefan. We went through my best case-worst case scenario and we made a plan, how to go on. He suggested to use Unity-time line and a tutorial series.
https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys
I made a plan for the next week in my calendar.

#### 16.02
I'm following this tutorial about Unity Timeline.
It will probably make my life very easy and save me from a lot of coding, yesss! I already have the walls growing and the ceiling moving. I made an attempt or the robot vacuum cleaner's moving as well, but i made a mistake, i'll redo it later. my computer crashed, so I decided to edit the sound first, so i have a timeline and I can make the unity timeline according to that. I edited the text considering Thomas's suggestions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uBFM3YUF4
I edited my previous voiceover recording. I noted down the times of the voiceover and when are the changes I need in the space that i can use for the unity timeline. 

#### 18.02
I wrote up the positions my robot vacuum cleaner should have, because it seemed like the timeline catches everything I do. It didn't really do what I wanted and it went through the walls, which actually looks very funny, I'm not sure if it is bad. I created a floor prefab, containting the columns, window and beams that I don't want to grow, and I added a few floors, which appear when the ceiling reaches their height. It doesn't look bad (except for the proportions of the beams), how it is growing, so maybe I will go with this direction of showing scale. The bad proportions of the beam gave me the idea to put those wires on the top of them, which are against pidgeons, they look really stupid in real life as well, but in this context it has some irony.

#### 20.02
I downloaded Ableton to the uni laptop, I downloaded github desktop to the uni laptop and I uploaded my unity file to github, so if my computer is about to crash, things will be still fine. I'm looking for background music for the experience, Brian Eno: Music for Airports is the perfect background music for my head, it's hard to think about anything else. Unfortunately Juli is superbusy, so I can't ask her opinion. I added my voiceover to the scene, and I fell asleep watching this tutorial about Unity and sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OT43pvUyfY

#### 21.02
I recorded and cut the voiceover again with the edited text, it is more energetic now and less depressed. I made the voiceover 3d in unity, which gives an interesting effect to it. I have to unnoise the recording in Premier. A friend showed me Ableton, and we imported my voiceover in it, and now I kind of know how to put effects on it.


#### 22.02
We had a meeting with Stefan, he suggested to use the reverp effect in ableton for showing the roomsize, and i think i'd be able to do it. We also discussed how to go further, i'm excited. I quickly denoised in Premiere the voiceover. 
I tried my experience in VR. 
Things that are needed: the robot vacuum cleaner is too big, I'm standing in a too low position. I should really implement the teleport option. Some beams and the window are flashing in a weird way which is annoying. The window is a bit too big.

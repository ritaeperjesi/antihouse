# antihouse

## Concept
This is an experience exploring the possibilities of creating spaces in virtual reality. Architecture is based on rules of reality: gravity, the strenght of materials, the size of humans and our ability of how we can move in spaces, all these aspects give limitations and shape our spaces. In virtual reality these rules can be modified easily. 100 meter high towers can be built from gummybears, we are able to teleport, materials and spaces are not contrapoints. What can we do with all these possibilities?

## Storyline
[miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ld9aCN4=/)
You are standing in a room, and a voice starts talking to you. It's the space around you, who got into the virtual reality, and is a bit confused what to do with this situation.
She is trying to find her function and shape in this digital world, by going through tha usual architypes of spaces, their aspects, elements, and opening new horizonts. 
The space is changing according to it's ideas. 
The function of the human can be also reconsidered in this story. 
The end can be an interactive open ending, where the human can change it to his/her liking. 

#### Introduction
Hi, I'm the space around you. I guess you didn't even see me, usually people just look through me, it's fine, I'm kind of used to this. 


#### Scale
Should I be small? Should I be big? I can actually be infinitely big! Hello, Burj Khalifa with your 828 meters, look at me! I can do the same but also made of gummybears, isn't it cool? or i can just balance on a needle too, can you do that? 

small-big-infinite
#### Shape
cube-sphere-weird generative morph

#### In-Out

#### Architypes

#### Elements
Greek coloumns turning into wobbly dancing gummi thingies
walls opening with more and more windows, turn into bubble 
handforest (ij ust write it here not to forget)

#### 09.11. consultation with Stefan
Homework: 
- set up environment
- oculus quest + unity
- unity + github

#### 12.11. consultation with Miklós
- "normal" people are not really into spaces. At architecture school you are taught to pay attention to spaces, but otherwise it is quite an abstract way of sensing the world.
- talking space idea
- spaceship house, old architypes of spaces, bubble archtype, where else can this go?

##### Space architypes: 
Research on this more! 
Island, sírbolt, nest, forest, egg
traveling: ship? cave (üreg), tunnel (alagút), church, house, égi jeruzsálem?  - i'm not sure if this is relevant

#### 16.11. consultation with Domi + thinking
-make it black and white - it's only about the space - colors can appear at some point, but it's about their meaning
- Wolves in the Walls VR experience, I love the handmade textures, chalk lines, there is an episode where you go through the wall and you are in between the elements, it is really cool.
Technical:
-Setting up work environment: https://circuitstream.com/blog/oculus-quest-unity-setup/
  I've been following this.

#### 03.12. 
I downloaded a free gummybear model, which I'm not entirely happy with. 
The Houdini engine doesn't work with my free houdini, so i'll have to check if the uni computer has the right houdini licence

#### 06.12. 
Problem: 
I installed the right android platforms i think. 
I'm following this: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Unity/2019.2.10f1/Editor/Data/Documentation/en/Manual/VRDevices-Oculus.html and I need a file, but: 
https://developer.oculus.com/manage/tools/osig-generator/ 
here I can't get my devices number, because adb devices is not a command on my computer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwmWGE3fFY
Solution: turn on developer mode on your phone in Oculus app

Questions: houdini licence?

#### 8.12. 
Unity workshop, a very fast sketch for the gummybear tower. Pierre suggested to randomize the directions of them.

![gummybear](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/gumibeartower.jpg)

#### 10.12. 
consultation with Miklós.
we discussed the meaning of the different visual styles and how far simplifying space can go. Our good friend, Lilla Turi is an illustrator, she is going very well in the world of abstraction. I have to experiment and I'll see what works and what doesn't in this weird 3d world.

#### 17.12. 
I started building a new scene with different textures. I have columns now, and I want to use a robot vacuum cleaner as the reference for the scale. 
First I wanted to use a bird, so it could fly around the space which would indicate well the size of it, but a bird would have to be perfect in terms of moving and how it looks.
A robot vacuum cleaner can be as stupid as it wants to be, I can code its movement, it's also working with scale and boundaries and it's a great companion in this story, as there is not much dirt in vr.

![basic room](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/porszivo.jpg)

Consultation with Miklós:
We discussed the possibilities with columns, that their scale can be any big, although there are some more usual ones, like the 2floor high ones. 
I want to indicate scale with multiplying the number of columns and not making them bigger in themselves. 
We talked about wallpapers, as they are funny and it is understandable to have them weirdly cut, but I can also cut weirdly columns, but that's less understandable.
What defines scale in 2020 architecture? toilet, lavatory, bathtube, window (1.5x1.5m?), door. 
I kind of like the idea of the magical growing space of a toilet as well, and tiles are giving a scale to everything, but as tiles are usually 15cm, that is too small already and it might lose its importance in bigger scales. 

#### 20.12.
I started watching Daniel Shiffman's [tutorials] (https://thecodingtrain.com/beginners/git-and-github/) about Git and Github. It's time to finally learn this thing.
#### 21.12.
Why is Houdini Engine good? [tutorial](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-engine-for-unity-session-sync/) 
This looks really cool.
This doesn't look like a simple thing, but maybe it is not that bad[Building a Simple Houdini Engine Exportertutorial](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/building-a-simple-houdini-engine-exporter/)
This is a nice overview for Houdini with Unity  [3 videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlCD7lJubes)

#### 23.12.
Consultation with Stefan about the Houdini-Unity workflow. I'll just try things in Unity first.

#### 01.01.
I started writing my voiceover in English. I watched one more Daniel Shiffman tutorial, I downloaded Githubdesktop and I installed it. Now I kind of can push my files from my desktop to github. 

#### 06.01.
best case- worst case scenario list

#### 10.01.
most details on the worst case scenario
writing the short version of my voiceover.
recording in a bad quality the voiceover. i have to buy AAA batteries to my diktafon. 
And I'm not fully sure if i should be the voice. 

#### 11.01.
editing the voiceover. asking my sound friends about how to record in good quality and if my voice is suitable for being the voice of the space. finalizing my bestcase-worstcase list. discussing it with Stefan. showing my voiceover to a friend, she said i'm using too many "filling" expressions when i talk, which is true. i have to pay more attention to this. 

#### 12.01.
timeplan, best case - worst case list

#### 13.01.
rewriting the concept

#### 21.01.
working in unity: 
- i made the ceiling go up with a script


#### 21.01.
I recorded the short version voiceover with Juli's microphone in good sound quality, less good acting quality than before. 

#### 24.01.
I played a bit with skybox textures, to find a friendlier atmoshphere. 
![basic room](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/unicorn.jpg)

#### 25.01.
I tried to see my world in VR, but something was weird, my gummybear tower was glitching, it was only good if I looked at a specific direction, it felt like maybe the gummybear tower is too much for it. :S
Quick check-in with Stefan.

#### 29.01.
I discussed my voiceover with an editor, he made some little corrections.

#### 15.02
Talking with Stefan. We went through my best case-worst case scenario and we made a plan, how to go on. He suggested to use Unity-time line and a tutorial series.
https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys
I made a plan for the next week in my calendar.

#### 16.02
I'm following this tutorial about Unity Timeline.
It will probably make my life very easy and save me from a lot of coding, yesss! I already have the walls growing and the ceiling moving. I made an attempt or the robot vacuum cleaner's moving as well, but i made a mistake, i'll redo it later. my computer crashed, so I decided to edit the sound first, so i have a timeline and I can make the unity timeline according to that. I edited the text considering Thomas's suggestions.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_uBFM3YUF4
I edited my previous voiceover recording. I noted down the times of the voiceover and when are the changes I need in the space that i can use for the unity timeline. 

#### 18.02
I wrote up the positions my robot vacuum cleaner should have, because it seemed like the timeline catches everything I do. It didn't really do what I wanted and it went through the walls, which actually looks very funny, I'm not sure if it is bad. I created a floor prefab, containting the columns, window and beams that I don't want to grow, and I added a few floors, which appear when the ceiling reaches their height. It doesn't look bad (except for the proportions of the beams), how it is growing, so maybe I will go with this direction of showing scale. The bad proportions of the beam gave me the idea to put those wires on the top of them, which are against pidgeons, they look really stupid in real life as well, but in this context it has some irony.
![beam](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/gerenda.jpg)

#### 20.02
I downloaded Ableton to the uni laptop, I downloaded github desktop to the uni laptop and I uploaded my unity file to github, so if my computer is about to crash, things will be still fine. I'm looking for background music for the experience, Brian Eno: Music for Airports is the perfect background music for my head, it's hard to think about anything else. Unfortunately Juli is superbusy, so I can't ask her opinion. I added my voiceover to the scene, and I fell asleep watching this tutorial about Unity and sounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OT43pvUyfY

#### 21.02
I recorded and cut the voiceover again with the edited text, it is more energetic now and less depressed. I made the voiceover 3d in unity, which gives an interesting effect to it. I have to unnoise the recording in Premier. A friend showed me Ableton, and we imported my voiceover in it, and now I kind of know how to put effects on it.


#### 22.02
We had a meeting with Stefan, he suggested to use the reverp effect in ableton for showing the roomsize, and i think i'd be able to do it. We also discussed how to go further, i'm excited. I quickly denoised in Premiere the voiceover. 
I tried my experience in VR. 
Things that are needed: the robot vacuum cleaner is too big, I'm standing in a too low position. I should really implement the teleport option. Some beams and the window are flashing in a weird way which is annoying. The window is a bit too big. 

#### 23.02
I finished watching the Unity timeline tutorial, and I made my tower with the right parameters which worked fine and than I added the space growing in every direction, and somehow it mixed up all the parameters, so my tower didn't work anymore. and even when the space  was big, it didn't look so big, so i think i should use fog. 

#### 24.02
I watched a tutorial about how to switch scenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE9VOZivb3I
I changed the texture on the walls to a grandma style wallpaper, I find it very funny. I also like how the pattern is changing when the space is growing, it is giving a nice feeling of scale. The robot vacuum cleaner is still a bit too big. I tried it in vr.
The beams and the window might be flickering as they might be 2 objects overlapping. 
The space growing works really well, this is exactly the feeling I wanted, when the tower is growing, it could be a bit slower at the beginning though, because soon it doesn't matter so much anymore that it is growing. When it is growing bigger, it should be a lot bigger! 
And I'm thinking about if I need the columns and the beams, they should behave some other way. And I should change the window.

#### 25.02
I showed Anna the current state of the VR experience. 
I've been working on the gummybear tower script, I created a new scene for it. I've spent emberassingly a lot of time figuring out how to do the coordinates for the gummybear instantiating script. I made my Unity crash 2 times with the 800 meters high gummybear collections, so I started to work with 200 meter high ones, and probably you can't see what's going on higher, so i'll create a similar texture and just put 4 cubes on the higher floors. I also just put cubes now instead of the gummybears, as my computer wouldn't handle so complex shapes too well, so I'll try to model a lowpoly gummybear, or to do it with a texture. 
![bear](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/gumimaci_inprocess1.jpg)

#### 27.02
I created an array of Gameobjects based on this link: https://answers.unity.com/questions/915759/how-to-instantiate-a-random-object-from-an-array.html
So I can have different colours for the gummybears. They are instantiated randomly. I like the red gummybears the most, I might try to double the chances for them, but I'm not sure if it is fair with the other gummybears. Now I still have gummybrick-like prefabs instead of the gummybears. 
This was the first time, that I wasn't frustrated about coding, now I'm getting comfortable with creating public variables(?), so I can change things in the unity interface and not in code, and I knew that I need an array (which in my head is still a bit of a blurry thing on the execution side), and I just googled exactly what I wanted and I understood what I need from what they write and what I don't.  
![bear](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/colorful.jpg)

#### 01.03
This hasn't been my most thought-through day so far. I had the feeling that my computer wouldn't support my gummybear tower dreams if I just switch my bricks to the gummybear models I downloaded, so I started to make a gummybear in Houdini. Somehow the subtract node and the merge node or actually any nodes that I wanted to use didn't appear, even though I googled quite some time, so I got pissed off, and I downloaded Blender. I chose a white theme for it, which looks very friendly, and I started watching a beginner tutorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4 which is quite nice, I made a monkey head smoke. Meanwhile, I panicked that maybe I should trust my computer and try the old gummybear model, so I changed the red bricks to red gummybears, but somehow there is something weird with the coordinates, so they are not in an organized space, and also they are a bit creepy. And my computer wasn't happy, so I came back to blender, and I'm watching another tutorial now. I made some drawings about gummybear geometry, and I ate quite some gummybears as studying their shape. 
I also started to think that maybe I should just paint the mesh of them and put them on my cubes, I knew how to use a software for this a few years ago, but I forgot. So my mind is jumping from one idea to another one now, which is not the best method to work by the way. www.substance3d.com I quickly asked a 3d friend which is the better way, I'll just keep trying with the blender, it's useful to know anyway.
But here are some creepy gummybear pictures.

#### 02.03
I watched this blender tutorial, for the gummybear modeling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaT-uG5wgUw 
I had consultation with Stefan. We discussed my gummybear problem, he suggested to have 3 kinds of gummy bear representations, the closer ones are higher poly, the middle ones are lower poly, and the distant ones are just a picture on a flat object. He suggested to use the decimate modifier in blender to create less polygons on my already existing gummybears. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqoIGxUrLbw I followed this tutorial, and it worked, my computer is not crashing anymore from my gummybear tower. I still want to model my own bear later, but maybe now it is not essential.
I decided to orgnaize my project better, and use a different Unity scene for each of my scenes, so in the future it is easier to add the new scenes for the next episodes, and if the animations are shorter, it is easier to keep everything in order. 
I cut the sound again to each scenes parts. 
I made my wallpaper seamless, and I changed the skybox to a lighter one, so it's a happier place. I still hate how it looks like, and I've been looking up textures as inspiration, I remembered an Ai Weiwei exhibition I saw with these contemporary kitchy golden textures, and that's a good inspiration. I feel like my brain is stuck on this topic, eventhough this is where I'm the most competent here.
I looked up the spatial sound effects in ableton, in the Reverb folder, there are really cool ones for all kinds of spaces, for example the Spacious one is a good start. My audio quality is not as good as I thought (I listened to it on headphones now).

#### 05.03
I created my scene-switching code based on this tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjFt-iScdfI
and this forum thingy
https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-do-i-calculate-accurately-time-passed-in-seconds-for-c.191434/
I created all my scenes now. 
I talked about my visual struggle with my architect-illustrator friend, Lilla, she had some nice suggestions.  She said, she likes this postmodern random things put together, but she said I could use a strict colour palette in this case, for example to use black and white and 1 colour, because in real life we can never have that otherwise to have the same colour of different things. I changed my materials to yellow and red, and changed some lighting options, and I already feel a lot better in the space. She also mentioned that in drawing classes, chairs are used as our eyes are very much used to their scale, so we immediately know if the scale is off a bit, and the Thonet chair is having this perfect correlation to human body's proportions. I'll look for a chair model. She also suggested to have a curtain moving, to have this feeling of ambience, and so the beginning might be less boring like that.
I've put all the sound files in the project and made the scene switching as long as it should be. Later i deleted these things, as I wanted to try out certain scenes only, but at least I know that it works.
Denise helped me to find the problems with my gummybear scene, which worked weirdly in VR. We discovered that my gummybears are the problem, they require too much rendering process, as they are not lowpoly enough, and their material's calculations with all the lights are also taking up too much calculations. We also created a 1 pixel big texture for the gummybears, which I find hilarious. I post it here as well. 
![1pixel](https://github.com/ritaeperjesi/antihouse/blob/master/img/YELLOW.jpg)
She also showed me how to put a button in there, so I could restart my scenes from the VR, but actually I'm not sure if I want it to be an option, and I don't use my controllers in the experience, I want the viewer just to be a viewer here.
I worked on the animations, but it turned out that I only made one animator thing, so when i did the animations for an other scene, i lost my previous work, which was stupid, but now i know. 
Denise also suggested to have a better organization in my Unity, which makes sense, I already felt superorganized by having folders for different things (yeah, I'm really messy), but she showed me how to organize my gameobjects in the scenes. We also discussed my github desktop problem, which was just that I should have closed Unity, before trying to upload the files. :S

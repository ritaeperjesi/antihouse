# Worst Case
## CONCEPT:
- [ ] coming up with concept
- [ ] moodboard
- [ ] architectural concept 
- [ ] storyboard
- [ ] copywriting
- [ ] spatial design
- [ ] visual style design
- [ ] finding 3d elements
- [ ] creating materials and textures

## STORYLINE:
### playing with the scale 
- [ ] intro - hi, i'm the space // basic scene + voiceover
- [ ] the space grows tall //  basic scene + voiceover + walls growing in Unity
- [ ] the tower becomes made of gummybears // basic scene + gummybear element + tower generation in Unity + voiceover
- [ ] the space grows big //  basic scene + voiceover + walls growing in Unity
- [ ] the space becomes very small, and there is a space around you. // change to other skybox? space walls shrinking in unity + voiceover
- [ ] outro - the space leaves you // new empty scene (what is empty?) + voiceover
## UNITY:
- [ ] walls are moving or elements are adding up
- [ ] you are able to move

## VISUAL DETAILS:
- [ ] decent looking environment
- [ ] it has a characteristic style
## SOUND:
- [ ] voiceover recorded and implemented
- [ ] some effect sounds
- [ ] basic background music (a song already existing)
## EXPORT TO VR:
- [ ] works on my oculus
## DOCUMENTATION:
- [ ] record a screenplay
- [ ] concept description 
- [ ] pretty screenshots
- [ ] my diary github md file



# Best Case
## STORYLINE:
### intro
- [ ] hi, i'm the space
### playing with the scale
- [ ] the space grows tall
- [ ] the tower becomes made of gummybears
- [ ] the space grows big
- [ ] the space becomes very small, and there is a space around you. 
### where are you in space?
- [ ] why to be on the ground //move everything in the scene a down. except the robot vacuum cleaner
- [ ] face down? not 90 degree turn // turn every object in the scene. except the robot vacuum cleaner.
### the shape of the space can change easily
- [ ] cube to sphere // create a cube to sphere 3d animation in houdini and export it and implement it?. seems a bit tricky. also what happens to the columns? creating a texture or our space? or recreating the space in houdini and than sphere-ing it. 
- [ ] sphere to weird moving morph // taking the audio reactive sphere from Simon's tutorial, and add it on the top of the previous space?
### do we need walls in the world of pixels?
- [ ] walls to lines // change the texture of the wall to a seethrough line one.
- [ ] lines to particles // particle system at the place of the walls
- [ ] particles to fog // particles have smaller and smaller pieces and they disappear, fog in unity appears
- [ ] fog to nothing // fog's density going to 0 and than turn it off
- [ ] inisible walls // colliders - you can't move
### what does it mean to be inside and outside? 
- [ ] inside - normal cube 
- [ ] outside - outside world // new skybox, 2 cubes from the outside
- [ ] being outside but being in a big cube // big cube 
- [ ] rain inside // hm. i'll look up a tutorial
- [ ] upside down rain inside 
### what is the architectural elements function in vr? 
- [ ] column forest  // instantiate many columns in unity
- [ ] create a tree like leaning column animation in houdini. instentiate that at the same places of the previous ones.
- [ ] architectural elements in a weird constellation // ideally this would be an array of elements, who are instantiated in the space in a random way. or i build it together once by hand. they have the shape of the orignial cube.
- [ ] they "explode a bit", so they are flying in space, like in the david o'reilly experience.
### outro
- [ ] the space leaves you // normal space. falls to particles and blends away? 

## UNITY:
- [ ] walls are moving or elements are adding up
- [ ] you are able to move
- [ ] the robot vacuum cleaner is moving around
- [ ] import houdini animations
- [ ] little interactive sounds (if you touch something)
- [ ] the robot vacuum cleaner is moving around
- [ ] line walls
- [ ] line walls to particle walls
- [ ] particle walls
- [ ] particle walls to fog
- [ ] fog disappears
- [ ] rain

## HOUDINI:
- [ ] cube to sphere animation 
- [ ] sphere to morph animation
## VISUAL DETAILS:
- [ ] decent looking environment
- [ ] it has a characteristic style
- [ ] more objects, details in the environment
## SOUND:
- [ ] voiceover recorded and implemented
- [ ] some effect sounds
- [ ] basic background music
- [ ] spatial effect
- [ ] little interactive sounds (if you touch something)
## EXPORT TO VR:
- [ ] works on other people's oculus too
## DOCUMENTATION
- [ ] record a screenplay
- [ ] concept description 
- [ ] pretty screenshots
- [ ] my diary github md file
- [ ] impressive trailer
